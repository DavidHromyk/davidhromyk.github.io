So here goes my first tutorial blog. Recently I had the idea to automate sending slack messages once a week without my intervation. I figured it would be great if I could laissez-faire my Slack account and let my automation work wonders.

**Here goes nothing!**

### Prerequisites 

In order for this setup to work there are a few prereqesuites that need to be met. 

* An Ubuntu 18.04 server on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)


How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
